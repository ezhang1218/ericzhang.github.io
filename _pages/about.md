Hi!

I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. I graduated from Cornell University in 2021. 

My research interests include high-dimensional statistics, time series,
and machine learning, both theoretical and applied. In my free time, I enjoy playing chess,
basketball, and the guitar. 

Feel free to reach out to me at eyzhang@unc.edu!
