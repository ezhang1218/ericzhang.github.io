Welcome to my home page!

I am currently a 1st year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. My research interests are in machine learning and numerical analysis, both
theoretical and applied. 

Besides school, I enjoy reading, playing the guitar, and photography!
