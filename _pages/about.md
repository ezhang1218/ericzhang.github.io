Hi!

I am currently a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. I graduated from Cornell University in 2021 with a B.A. in math and statistics. I'm currently advised by [Didong Li](https://sites.google.com/view/didongli/home)
and [Michael Kosorok](https://tarheels.live/kosoroklab/).

My research interests include high-dimensional statistics, time series, dimension reduction, and data analysis. In my free time, I enjoy videography,
basketball, used to play chess competitively (add me on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/yellowmamba303)!)

Feel free to reach out to me at eyzhang@unc.edu!
