Hi!

I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. I graduated from Cornell University in 2021. I'm currently advised by [Didong Li](https://sites.google.com/view/didongli/home)
and [Michael Kosorok](https://tarheels.live/kosoroklab/).

My research interests include high-dimensional statistics, time series,
and machine learning, both theoretical and applied. In my free time, I enjoy photography,
basketball, used to play chess competitively.

Feel free to reach out to me at eyzhang@unc.edu!
